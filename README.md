# DoseGuardian-Intelligent-Pill-Taking-Assistant
DoseGuardian is a real-time embedded healthcare reminder system developed using LPC21xx ARM7 microcontroller and Embedded C. The system uses a Real-Time Clock (RTC) to track current time and compares it with a user-configured medicine schedule. When both times match, the system generates an alert using an LCD display, LED, and buzzer.
This project demonstrates practical implementation of real-time systems, peripheral interfacing, and modular firmware design.
